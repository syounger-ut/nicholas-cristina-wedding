content: |
  <p>Oxford gets very busy during the summer months. And unfortunately, the British Grand Prix is taking place at Silverstone during that weekend, making finding accommodation slightly more challenging.</p>
  <p><strong>If you have not booked yet, donÂ´t wait.</strong></p>

  <p>Hotels can be quite expensive in and around Oxford and get booked quickly. We found some availability here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/oxfordshire/oxford/oxford-cowley.html" target="_blank">Premier Inn</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://mercureoxfordhawkwellhouse.com" target="_blank">Mercure Oxford Hawkwell House Hotel</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Oxford/homes" target="_blank">AirBnB</a> is also a good option for a night or two in Oxford</li>
